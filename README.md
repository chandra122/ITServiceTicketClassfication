# IT Service Ticket Classification

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify IT service tickets. It focuses on solving the bias-variance tradeoff using regularization and cross-validation, providing a practical use-case for these core concepts.

## Features
- Classification of IT service tickets
- Implementation of regularization techniques
- Cross-validation for model selection
- Example dataset for experimentation

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
	```sh
	git clone <repo-url>
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```sh
	cd Classification/ITServiceTicketClassfication
	```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Install required Python packages:
	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset (see `all_tickets_processed_improved_v3.csv`).
2. Run the main script or notebook to train and evaluate models.
3. Adjust regularization and cross-validation parameters as needed.
